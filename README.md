# Zig package for ament_index

**This repo is deprecated, please see the [zigros mono repo](https://github.com/zig-robotics/zigros) for updates.**
Maintaining individual repos paired with the zig package manager is too error prone.

This provides a zig package for the ros2 ament_index project.
This currently targets zig 0.13 and ROS Jazzy.
